# React Wallet Clone

This project is a clone of Apple Wallet or Google Wallet built using React.js, Redux, and React Router. It allows users to manage virtual cards in a digital wallet, with features such as adding new cards, viewing card details, and interacting with cards.

## Features

- **Card Stacking:** Cards are displayed in a stack with the most recent card shown on top, replicating the behavior of real-world digital wallets like Apple Wallet.
  
- **Add Cards:** Users can add new cards to their wallet by filling out a form with card details such as card number, expiration date, and cardholder name.

- **View Card Details:** Users can view detailed information about each card in their wallet by clicking on the card.

- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be responsive and work seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.

- **Routing:** React Router is used for client-side routing, allowing users to navigate between different views such as the wallet view and the add card form view.

- **Redux State Management:** Redux is used to manage the state of the application, including the list of cards in the wallet and any user interactions with the cards.

- **Interactive Cards:** Users can interact with the cards by clicking on them, simulating actions such as selecting a card or flipping a card to view additional information.
